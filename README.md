# Basic Versioned Package Manager
BVPM is a basic package manager. It was written basically to make development of basic-linux easier.

BVPM is currently in a super-duper-early stage, and should not be used for anything but the most stupid systems.
It does not currently support dependencies, or anything like that (at least not very well).
